Hound CI Limitations
 Hound Ci is a code review tool which basically does style checks. Certain limitation with hound is that it does not consider external javascript that has be preloaded, so  comments like "Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression.Add a line note" from hound are not valid.
